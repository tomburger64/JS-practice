After an automated coding test, I realised my JS level was really weak (I am a beginner after all)
That made me get into studying some native javascript exercises (DOM / array manipulation), as even if learning more stuff can attract more recruiters, it doesn't stay afloat very long if there's no depth below it

Don't mind check the "last updated" time next to the folders / files you're looking for.
Doing this to improve my js skills and for the goal of someday being able to make my own apps by myself (no idea what they'll be though)

During september 2024, I focused mainly on array manipulation as it also is pretty useful for data manipulation and other things which I'm still discovering (and also coding recruitment tests)
For now (October), going after promises so I can learn how to deal with APIs, and then finally get myself into backend (probably NodeJS so I keep my tech stack in JS)
