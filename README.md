After an automated coding test, I realised my JS level was really weak (I am a beginner after all)
That made me get into studying some native javascript exercises (DOM / array manipulation), as even if learning more stuff can attract more recruiters, it doesn't stay afloat very long if there's no depth below it

I should mention, I am active on this repo even if it doesn't show in my commit activity on my profile. Don't mind check the "last updated" time next to the folders / files you're looking for.
Doing this to improve my js skills and for fun

For now (september 2024), I'll focus mainly on array manipulation as it also is pretty useful for data manipulation and other things which I'm still discovering.

Each exercise script file is linked in the index.html file (if you plan on using it, don't forget to uncomment the script links at the bottom you want to take a look at)
You can of course just check the code directly from the files, there's always my answer to the exercise accompanied by the correction towards the bottom. Everything is pseudo-coded to avoid any confusion.

Index is in the main folder, and the exercises are in their respective folders:
- array-exercises folder which contains some exercises with array manipulation
- dom-exercises which is pretty self-explanatory
